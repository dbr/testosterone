========================================
    BUGS
========================================

=====DONE=====
line up time elapsed
in wrap function, specify string with syntax tree manipulations instead of literal string delimiters
None at end of output?


future
----------------------------------------
account for multiple small statements -- (need to make promote_node arbitrary?)
if there are tests inside of a loop that is itself called from a test, the output is sandwiched (rewrite for curses will solve this)



========================================
    FEATURES
========================================

clean up cli
    test*.py accept globs
    -a == *.pyt
    =====DONE=====
write man page
figure out how we want to package it
    SCRIPTS
    but man page needs Makefile?
release it
    epydoc -> docs.zetadev.com
    package w/ distutils
    www.zetadev.com/releases/
=====DONE=====
write tests for ASTutils and pytest
write tutorial
clean up output formatting
    same header top and bottom, w/ results
    line numbers
    h3 for FAILUREs (need to execute all terms of each test and capture the output)
set up software.zetweb.com & svn.zetaweb.com (!)


future
----------------------------------------
utils.reset -- re-sanitize the testing context (globals, locals, modules)
smarter output catching -- pprint, sys.stdout.write(?) -- patch .write()?
clean up cli
    -r recursive
    -1 stop after first output (failure, output, exception)
traceback shows eval context, not actual script context: is it meaningful/useful?
modify to run old PyUnit tests as well? (should just be able to intercept assert* and convert to regular test)
curses app! index of detailed reports, enter index number to see detail; F5 to refresh :-)
verbose mode; curses app would need to show detailed reports for passed tests as well
validate usage with non-standard python installations
running ast2text against the standard library unit tests
