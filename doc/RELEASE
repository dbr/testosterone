when svn is stable, tag the release, then update the following items on the tag:
    setup.py            version
    doc/testosterone.1  add note to HISTORY; change date
    Makefile            version variable at top
    site-packages/testosterone/__init__.py __version__

make dist will re-generate docs and build archives
    put docs and archives on zetadev.com/software
