when svn is stable, tag the release, then co the tag and do the following:

version needs to be bumped in the following places:
    setup.py
    README (paths in installation instructions)
    man/man1/pytest.1 (add note to HISTORY; change date)
    Makefile (version variable in doc/release section)

make release will re-generate docs and build archives

archives etc. won't go back in svn but docs will

when it's all set, check the tag WC back in

release is done!zs
