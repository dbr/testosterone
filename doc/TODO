    feedback while loading/updating
        spinning wheel is the easy out
        better is progress bar, but that means progressive communication with "server"
    need to be smarter about which tests to show
        don't show modules for which all tests pass
        don't show modules for which there are no test
        unless a submodule of that module has tests
    highlight current selection better
    distinguish fresh, stale, and un-run tests
    really should have pgup/pgdn/home/end
    ooh! delete removes module from testing list until next reload?
    need to display totals
