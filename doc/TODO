ought to have a TESTOSTERONE_STOPWORDS environment variable
ModulesScreen
ResultsScreen
ConsoleScreen
logging -- disable or put in temp directory or something


=====FUTURE=====
ModulesScreen
    highlight current selection better -- color!
    ooh! delete removes module from testing list until next reload?
    feedback while loading/updating
        better is progress bar, but that means progressive communication with "server"
        which is complicated because of program output or pdb sessions


=====DONE=====
ModuleScreen
    scroll off bottom of screen is buggy
    feedback while loading/updating
        spinning wheel is the easy out
    need to be smarter about which tests to show
        don't show modules for which all tests pass
        don't show modules for which there are no test
        unless a submodule of that module has tests
    highlighting
        fresh -- cyan
        stale -- dark blue
        un-run tests -- gray
        current modules -- bg
        current submodules -- bg
    bug: running 'task' yields no results!
    can't write to bottom left corner! -- hacked for now
    need to display totals
    really should have pgup/pgdn/home/end
