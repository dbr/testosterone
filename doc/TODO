consider a TESTOSTERONE_STOPWORDS environment variable
add ability to cancel a report refresh

ScrollArea
    consider wrapping: scroll off bottom jumps back to top
    still some edge cases out there I think
SummaryScreen
DetailScreen
    when focus is on result during refresh, refresh doesn't get refreshed
    down one, page down x2 error -- lost it, twice :^(
    up always beeps in result pane
    bug: fron traceback screen,
DebuggingScreen
    command history
    deal better with resizes
    try to keep scrollback (paging)



=====FUTURE=====
ModulesScreen
    highlight current selection better -- color!
    ooh! delete removes module from testing list until next reload?
    feedback while loading/updating
        better is progress bar, but that means progressive communication with "server"
        which is complicated because of program output or pdb sessions


=====DONE=====
SummaryScreen
    scroll off bottom of screen is buggy
    feedback while loading/updating
        spinning wheel is the easy out
    need to be smarter about which tests to show
        don't show modules for which all tests pass
        don't show modules for which there are no test
        unless a submodule of that module has tests
    highlighting
        fresh -- cyan
        stale -- dark blue
        un-run tests -- gray
        current modules -- bg
        current submodules -- bg
    bug: running 'task' yields no results!
    can't write to bottom left corner! -- hacked for now
    need to display totals
    really should have pgup/pgdn/home/end
    total highlight: white when unrun, red when failing, green when 100% passing
    currow should persist across runs
    bottom row should show current selection and stats
    bug: summary borks on base='testosterone.test'
    bug: resize smaller borks
    bug: not using last row of listing
    bug: not seeing bottom continuation indicator
    need to do something with errors
    continuation indicators -> scrollbars!
    should refuse to attempt run for module with 0 tests
ModuleScreen -> SummaryScreen
DetailScreen
    Detail
    should immediately switch and then show 'working...'
    move module name to bottom
    make panes scroll -- includes arrows and continuation indicators
    format result with textwrap
    resize shouldn't trigger refresh
    consider putting the usual totals from summary in the footer (red/green)
    continuation indicators -> scrollbars!
    q: KeyboardInterrupt -> ESC
    enter -> opens traceback in ErrorScreen
    hitting enter should update stats before going to DetailScreen
    add left/right key support
    should only go to DetailScreen if tests don't pass
    trim module name in footer
    loses selection returning from DetailScreen
    result not cleaned between displays
refactor to account for TestCase in between module and individual tests
DebuggingScreen
    proxying a child process's stdin/stdout
    selectively triggering I/O proxing based on the output
    capture lines of input and pass them back to the client
    react to EOF
    exit cleanly
    safely restore curses state after exiting DebuggingScreen
