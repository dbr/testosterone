========================================
    BUGS
========================================

account for multiple small statements -- (need to make promote_node arbitrary?)
if there are tests inside of a loop that is itself called from a test, the output is sandwiched (rewrite for curses will solve this)
on CRISIS, output gets written to report twice
if no output, only show one summary
breaks with ZopeTestCase
=====DONE=====
line up time elapsed
in wrap function, specify string with syntax tree manipulations instead of literal string delimiters
None at end of output?
sys.path[0] needs to be file's sys.path[0], not /usr/local/bin/





========================================
    FEATURES
========================================

release it
    fix a few more bugs
    =====DONE=====
    epydoc -> docs.zetadev.com
    package w/ distutils
    www.zetadev.com/releases/
=====DONE=====
figure out how we want to package it
    SCRIPTS
    but man page needs Makefile?
write man page
clean up cli
    test*.py accept filename patterns
write tests for ASTutils and pytest
write tutorial
clean up output formatting
    same header top and bottom, w/ results
    line numbers
    h3 for FAILUREs (need to execute all terms of each test and capture the output)
set up software.zetweb.com & svn.zetaweb.com (!)


future
----------------------------------------
utils.reset -- re-sanitize the testing context (globals, locals, modules)
smarter output catching -- pprint, sys.stdout.write(?) -- extend .write()?
clean up cli
    -a = *.pyt
    -r recursive
    -1 stop after first output (failure, output, exception)
traceback shows eval context, not actual script context: is it meaningful/useful?
modify to run old PyUnit tests as well? (should just be able to intercept assert* and convert to regular test)
curses app! index of detailed reports, enter index number to see detail; F5 to refresh :-)
verbose mode; curses app would need to show detailed reports for passed tests as well
document usage with non-standard python installations
    afaict this works: ~/bin/my-python /usr/local/bin/pytest tutorial.pyt
    you can also copy /usr/local/bin/pytest to /usr/local/bin/mytest and change the hashbang line
run ast2text against the standard library unit tests
register with PyPI?
